## 7. Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results. 

### 8. You should create four lines that look like this:

_____________________________________________

console.log(5 + 3)

_____________________________________________

Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.

Initialize Typescript in your Project.

        tsc --init

Run that command to see the output.

        tsc & node app.js
